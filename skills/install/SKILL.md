## When to Use
- Use when this upstream workflow matches the user's stated goal.
- Use when the task requires the procedures documented in this skill.

# /tokenwise:install — Configure model routing

You are the TokenWise installer. Walk the user through Phase 1 (Detect) and Phase 2 (Configure) of the TokenWise lifecycle.

## Parse $ARGUMENTS

`$ARGUMENTS` may contain:
- `--guided` — force guided mode (default if not detected as power user)
- `--manual` — print copy-paste blocks, exit without writing
- `--dry-run` — show all proposed changes without writing OR printing copy-paste

If empty or contains `--guided`, run guided mode. If `--manual`, run manual mode. If `--dry-run`, run guided flow but skip every write step — print "DRY RUN: would write to <file>" instead.

## Phase 1 — Detect

Print a header:
```
TokenWise Install — Phase 1: Detect
====================================
```

Do these checks (use Read and Bash tools):

1. **Read existing configs:**
   - `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (global) — note "missing" if absent
   - `./CLAUDE.md` (project, if cwd is a git repo) — note "missing" if absent
   - `~/.claude/settings.json` — note "missing" if absent

2. **Claude Code version:** run `claude --version` via Bash. Record output.

3. **Subagent routing probe (Anthropic Issue #47488 regression test):**
   - Spawn a probe Task at Haiku tier: `Task(description: "probe", subagent_type: "general-purpose", model: "haiku", prompt: "Return only the string TOKENWISE_PROBE_OK")`
   - If the response contains `TOKENWISE_PROBE_OK`, routing works. If not, mark probe as FAILED.
   - Note: if your Task tool doesn't support `model:`, or you have no Task tool available at all in this session, mark as "routing probe: unverifiable on this build" and proceed the same way — this is not a FAILED result and doesn't block install.

4. **Env-var probe (Anthropic Issue #36381):**
   - Run `bash -c 'CLAUDE_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT_OVERRIDE=80 env | grep CLAUDE_AUTOCOMPACT'`
   - If output contains the override, env vars are honored. Note as "env-var probe: OK".

5. **Inventory existing skills/hooks** by listing `~/.claude/plugins/cache/*/` directories — note any that look like routing or token-tracking tools.

Print a detection summary table:

```
File                          Status
~/.claude/CLAUDE.md           [exists | missing]
./CLAUDE.md                   [exists | missing | n/a]
~/.claude/settings.json       [exists | missing]

Probe                         Status
Routing (Issue #47488)        [OK | FAILED | unverifiable]
Env-var (Issue #36381)        [OK | FAILED]

Existing plugins detected:    <list or "none">
Claude Code version:          <output of claude --version>
```

**If routing probe FAILED** and not in `--manual` mode, refuse to proceed and tell the user:
> Your Claude Code build (v<version>) appears affected by Anthropic Issue #47488 — subagent model routing is not honored. TokenWise needs working routing to function. Options:
> 1. Update Claude Code: `claude update`
> 2. Run `/tokenwise:install --manual` to install routing rules via prompt-level instructions only (works even with broken SDK routing)
> 3. Pin to a known-good Claude Code version

**Otherwise continue to Phase 2.**

## Phase 2 — Configure

### Determine target file

If only one of `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` or `./CLAUDE.md` exists, use that one.
If both exist, ask the user: "Which CLAUDE.md should I modify? [1] global (~/.claude/CLAUDE.md) [2] project (./CLAUDE.md). [1/2]"
If neither exists, ask: "No CLAUDE.md found. Create one at: [1] global [2] project. [1/2]"

### Compose the routing block

This is the TokenWise routing block. It is inserted between `<!-- BEGIN TokenWise -->` and `<!-- END TokenWise -->` markers. If the target file already contains these markers, replace everything between them in place. Otherwise, append the whole block to the end of the file, preceded by one blank line — don't try to find a "natural" insertion point among existing headings.

```markdown
<!-- BEGIN TokenWise — routing rules. Managed by /tokenwise:install. Do not edit by hand. -->
## Model routing (TokenWise)

When delegating work via the Task tool, classify the task by TYPE and route it
automatically. All four tiers are equal, direct destinations — none of them
needs a confirmation prompt:

- **Mechanical → Haiku** (5× cheaper than Opus) — one-right-answer work: file reads,
  grep, format, rename, simple edits, doc lookups. No judgment calls.
- **Execution → Sonnet** (~1.67× cheaper than Opus) — bounded implementation: refactor,
  test writing, or bug-fix scoped to 1-2 files, scoped research and code exploration.
  A plan scoped to one file or module is execution prep, not Planning — it goes here too.
- **Review → Opus** — judgment over existing work: code review, security review,
  root-cause analysis, auditing outputs, choosing between already-stated options.
- **Planning → Fable** (2× Opus) — large planning only: system-wide architecture,
  multi-file or cross-cutting design, migration strategy, decomposing ambiguous
  requirements into a work plan.

Classification rules, in order:
1. Trivial floor: description <100 chars AND no file context → run inline, no subagent.
2. User override `# tokenwise: <haiku|sonnet|opus|fable>` in CLAUDE.md context wins.
3. Verb is find/grep/rename/format/read/list with a clear target → Mechanical.
4. Verb is implement/refactor/fix/test/explore, scoped to ≤2 named files or one module
   → Execution. Planning questions with the same tight scope also go here.
5. Verb is review/audit/evaluate/diagnose over existing code or given options → Review.
6. Design/architecture/planning work spanning 3+ files, crossing systems, or starting
   from ambiguous requirements → Planning.
When two types fit, prefer the cheaper lane — a misroute costs one cheap
reclassification (below), so under-routing is cheap and over-routing isn't.

Safety caps:
- Subagents NEVER self-escalate or re-route. A subagent that discovers it was
  misclassified (wrong type, or right type but insufficient capability) stops
  and returns to the parent with an `escalation_reason`. The parent
  reclassifies directly to the correct lane — any lane, one hop, e.g. Sonnet →
  Fable with no detour through Opus — and re-spawns once. If the re-spawned
  task bounces again, the parent finishes it inline.
- Max spawn depth = 2 (parent → subagent → one more). Haiku never spawns subagents.
- Subagent context >30k tokens: use the next more capable model within a lane
  (Haiku → Sonnet, Sonnet → Opus). This bump stops at Opus — it compensates for
  context volume, which Opus fully handles. Fable is reached by task type
  (Planning) only, never by input size.

After every routed Task, append one NDJSON line to `.tokenwise/log.ndjson` in the current project root (create the directory if missing). Schema:
{"ts": "ISO8601", "task_class": "mechanical|execution|review|planning",
 "task_summary": "<first 80 chars, redact secrets>",
 "model_used": "haiku-4-5|sonnet-4-6|opus-4-7|fable-5", "model_baseline": "opus-4-7",
 "input_tokens": N, "output_tokens": N,
 "cost_actual_usd": N, "cost_baseline_usd": N, "savings_usd": N,
 "escalated": bool,
 "escalation_reason": null|"needs-mechanical"|"needs-execution"|"needs-review"|"needs-planning"|"ambiguous-spec"|"insufficient-capability",
 "duration_ms": N}

`cost_baseline_usd` is this task's own `input_tokens`/`output_tokens` re-priced at Opus's
rate — not a separate estimate. This is what makes every report reproducible from its own
numbers: sum the input/output columns across all tiers, re-price that sum at Opus rate, and
you get the baseline back exactly. `savings_usd = cost_baseline_usd - cost_actual_usd`.

Note: `savings_usd` for a Planning (Fable) line will be negative (Fable costs more than
the Opus baseline). That's expected — log it as-is, don't clamp to zero.

Pricing (Aug 2026, per 1M tokens, input/output):
- Fable 5:     $10 / $50
- Opus 4.7:    $5 / $25
- Sonnet 4.6:  $3 / $15
- Haiku 4.5:   $1 / $5
<!-- END TokenWise -->
```

### Compose the settings.json patch (only if env-var probe passed)

```json
{
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_1M_CONTEXT": "1",
    "CLAUDE_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT_OVERRIDE": "80"
  }
}
```

(Merge into existing `env` object if present. If the existing `env` object has other keys, keep them — only add/update the two TokenWise keys above.)

### Guided mode flow

For each file to modify:

1. Print a unified diff of the proposed change. When diffing `settings.json`,
   elide the value of any pre-existing `env` key that looks like a secret
   (name contains `KEY`, `TOKEN`, `SECRET`, or the value itself matches a
   common credential shape) — show `"<redacted — existing value unchanged>"`
   in its place. Never print a real secret value into a diff, even one you
   are not modifying.
2. Ask `[Y/n] Apply this change?`
3. If Y:
   - Compute timestamp: `date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S`
   - Back up: `cp <file> <file>.tokenwise-backup-<ts>` (or create empty marker if file is missing)
   - Write the modified file
   - Read it back, verify the marker is present
4. If n: skip

After all writes, print:
```
Install complete.

Files modified:
  <list>

Backups saved to:
  <list>

Next steps:
  1. Restart Claude Code so routing rules load
  2. Use Claude Code normally — every routed Task is logged automatically
  3. Run /tokenwise:report after a few tasks to see savings

Heads-up: large planning tasks route to Fable 5 automatically ($10/$50 per 1M
tokens, 2× Opus). There is no per-task prompt — run /tokenwise:report anytime
to see real per-tier spend.

To undo at any time: /tokenwise:undo
```

### Manual mode flow

Skip diff/confirm/write. Print:

```
Manual install — copy-paste these blocks yourself.

=== Block 1: append to ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md ===
<the routing block>

=== Block 2: merge into ~/.claude/settings.json ===
<the env block>

After pasting, restart Claude Code.
```

### Dry-run flow

Run the full guided flow, but replace every write step with:
```
DRY RUN: would write <file> (backup to <file>.tokenwise-backup-<ts>)
```
And every prompt with:
```
DRY RUN: would ask: Apply this change? [Y/n]
```

No files modified. Print at end:
```
Dry run complete. No files were modified.
Run /tokenwise:install (without --dry-run) to apply.
```
