## When to Use
- Use when this upstream workflow matches the user's stated goal.
- Use when the task requires the procedures documented in this skill.

Execute the following command:

```bash
npx remotion studio --no-open
```

If the Studio is already opened, the URL will be printed and the command will exit.
Otherwise, a long-running process will start, and the URL will be printed.

Open the URL in the browser.

## Useful flags

| Argument          | Purpose                                                                                       |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--log=<level>`   | Set `error`, `warn`, `info` (default), or `verbose` logging.                                  |
| `--port=<number>` | Request a Studio server port; otherwise Remotion finds a free port.                           |
| `--force-new`     | Start another Studio instance even when one is already running for the same project and port. |

## Limitations

- Imported upstream skill; verify credentials, permissions, and safety boundaries before execution.
- Does not replace environment-specific validation, testing, or maintainer review.
